# Mu-P_Mapping

This repository contains code that I am using to explore the validity of
theoretical models for various chemical species that are of interest
to the lab I work for (The Space Group at the University of South
Florida.)

**Preliminaries:**

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and compile:

`git clone https://github.com/LucianoLaratelli/Mu-P_Mapping.git`
