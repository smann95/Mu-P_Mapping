# Mu-P_Mapping

This repository contains code that I am using to explore the validity of
theoretical models for various chemical species that are of interest
to the lab I work for (The Space Group at the University of South
Florida.)

This repository is intended to be entirely self-contained,
that is, one should be able to clone it to a cluster and begin
running jobs immediately assuming the .pqr files one wants are here.
